# FirebaseRelationships

This is a demo app focused on dealing with many-to-many relationships in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). Firebase is managed by the folks at Google. 



Being a nosql database, creating many-to-many relationships can be unintuitive. This app tries to handle that efficiently.
